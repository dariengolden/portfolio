# Portfolio Setup Guide

This portfolio website is optimized for showcasing videography projects using Mux for high-performance video streaming.

## Mux Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Mux Account
- Sign up at [mux.com](https://www.mux.com)
- Navigate to your dashboard

### 2. Upload Your Videos
- Go to the "Assets" section in Mux dashboard
- Upload your portfolio videos
- After upload, each video will receive a unique **Playback ID**

### 3. Configure Video Data

Open `src/data/videos.js` and replace the placeholder playback IDs with your actual Mux playback IDs:

```javascript
export const videoData = {
  "Social Media Reel": [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: "Your Video Title",
      playbackId: "abc123def456", // Replace with your actual Mux playback ID
      duration: "2:30",
      category: "Social Media Reel",
      metadata: {
        client: "Client Name",
        year: "2024",
        tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"]
      }
    }
  ],
  // Add more categories and videos...
};
```

### 4. Configure Hero Video

Update the hero video for your homepage:

```javascript
export const heroVideo = {
  playbackId: "your-hero-video-playback-id",
  title: "Showreel 2024"
};
```

## Adding New Videos

1. Upload video to Mux and get the playback ID

  id: 8, // Use a unique ID
  title: "New Project",
  playbackId: "new-mux-playback-id",
  duration: "3:45",
  category: "Corporate",
  metadata: {
    client: "Client Name",

## Troubleshooting

### Videos not loading
